# Task Management App (Track B)

A polished, functional task management app built with Flutter using local Hive database for persistence. Designed with a clean Material 3 UI and smooth transitions.

## Features

- **Task CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks
- **Task Model**: Title, Description, Due Date, Status (To-Do, In Progress, Done), and optional Blocked By relationship
- **Blocked Tasks**: Tasks blocked by incomplete tasks appear greyed out and cannot be edited until the blocking task is completed
- **Search & Filter**: Debounced search (300ms) by title; filter by status
- **Form Drafts**: Unfinished task drafts are preserved when app is minimized or user navigates back
- **2-Second Delay Simulation**: All create/update operations simulate a network delay with proper loading state and button disabling
- **UI/UX Polish**: Material 3 theme, smooth page transitions, responsive design

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>= 3.4.0)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extension

### Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Open terminal in the project directory
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

4. Generate Hive adapters:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

5. Run the app:

```bash
flutter run
```

### IDE Setup (Optional)

For automatic code generation in VS Code/Android Studio, you may install the `build_runner` and `Hive` extensions, but the command line method above works consistently.

## Track B Implementation Notes

- **State Management**: Provider pattern
- **Database**: Hive (NoSQL, local, fast)
- **UI**: Material Design 3 with custom theming
- **Screens**:
  - `MainScreen`: Task list with search, filter, and FAB for adding tasks
  - `TaskFormScreen`: Create/Edit task modal
- **Widgets**:
  - `TaskCard`: Displays task with status, due date, and blocking state

## Build & Release

To build an APK:

```bash
flutter build apk
```

For iOS (requires macOS):

```bash
flutter build ios
```

Built with Flutter & Hive for the Track B assignment.

AI Usage

I used Claude Code to help build the app, mainly with the MAGIC prompt approach. For fixing errors, I usually just shared the error messages since it already kept track of the context, which made things quick and easy.
